    <h1>1995 Impreza L Build</h1>
    <p>I've been wanting to build a race car for some time. After ample research,
    I decided I wanted a Toyota MR2 Spyder or a Mazda Miata (whichever was
    a better deal). That is until I found a 1995 Subaru Impreza for $1000 on
    craigslist. Depending on who you ask this is the lightest year for the
    platform and swapping in the more powerful WRX platform is reletively easy.</p>

    <p>I have since picked up a wrecked 2003 WRX and I'm currently removing it's
    components. My plan is to sell anything that's not needed for driving
    to recoupe some of the cost.</p>
